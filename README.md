The goal is to find the best-fitting line (a straight line in the case of simple linear regression) that represents the relationship between the variables.
At its core, linear regression is a method used in statistics and machine learning to understand the relationship between two variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting line (a straight line in the case of simple linear regression) that represents the relationship between the variables.

Imagine you have two sets of data points, where one set is the independent variable (let's call it X) and the other set is the dependent variable (let's call it Y). Linear regression helps you find a line (a mathematical equation) that approximates the relationship between X and Y.

In simple words, linear regression tries to draw the straight line that comes closest to all the points in your data. This line can then be used to make predictions. If you know the value of X, you can use the line to estimate the corresponding value of Y.

So, linear regression helps us understand and predict how one variable changes as another variable changes, assuming there is a linear relationship between them. The process involves finding the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual data points.
